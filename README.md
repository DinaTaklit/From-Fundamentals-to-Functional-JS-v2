## Objects

- We use Dot notation for only strings.
- We use brackets for: string, numbers, variables, weird characters, expressions.

> Why we use Dot then since we can use brackets for everything? =>  To save time.

### Destructuring

- it just makes getting values out of objects and arrays, have less typing.
- Variables Declarations (the patern used here called decoration patern):
  - const {first, second} = {first: 0, second:1}
  - let {first, second} = {first: 0, second:1}
  - var {first, second} = {first: 0, second:1}
- Assignement:
  - {first, second} = {first: 0, second:1}
